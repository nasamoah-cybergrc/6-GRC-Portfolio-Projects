# GRC Portfolio Projects – Nana Asamoah

Welcome to my **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)** portfolio — a collection of real-world inspired cybersecurity and compliance projects I’ve developed through my learning journey.

Each project demonstrates analytical, documentation, and technical skills that align with industry frameworks like **ISO 27001**, **NIST CSF**, and **CompTIA Security+**.
