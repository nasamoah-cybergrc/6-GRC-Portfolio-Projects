|--------|---------|-------------|----------|----------|---------|
| HR Data | Unauthorized access | Medium | High | A.9.2 – Access control policy | Mitigated |
| Laptops | Theft | Medium | Medium | A.8.3 – Asset management | Open |
| Cloud Storage | Misconfiguration | High | High | A.14.2 – Secure system engineering | Monitoring |
